    "## Adopt BLIP2 and LLM to solve content moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrate how we can adopt BLIP2 and LLM for content moderation. To align with the tradicitonal approach as [Moderating content](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/moderation.html), we also categorize contents into different categories. For each category, like check-list we define questions to check if the content belongs to that category. For few questions, we may just check if all answers meet the defined answers, but for many questions with different type answers, designing rule-based process may be complicated, therefore we leverage LLM to summarize the result based on the questions and answers from BLIP2 model. The architecture is below:\n",
